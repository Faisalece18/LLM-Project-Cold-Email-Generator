   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Faisalece18/LLM-Project-Cold-Email-Generator.git
   cd Cold-email-generator
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd LLM-Project-Cold-Email-Generator
    ```

3. **Create and Activate a Conda Environment**

    ```bash
    conda create --name GenAiProject python=3.8
    conda activate GenAiProject
    ```

4. **Install Required Packages**

    Install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Alternatively, you can install packages individually using conda or pip.
